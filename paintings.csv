Hospital Window,Gabe Mintzer,hospital,"This is the window that I reached when I visited at the end of my walks with my physical therapist at Spaulding Cambridge—I always liked the view, especially because it came at the end of a successful walk",2,0

Bearded Dragon,Varun Mangalick,lizard,This is my attempt at making a reasonably realistic lizard. I found that adding little dots gave a good impression of scales!,2,3
Blueberry the Betta,Varun Mangalick,betta,I painted this based on a picture I took of Blueberry the Betta angrily investigating a snail,2,4
Penguins,Varun Mangalick,varun_penguins,"This was from our first paint night where three of us painted penguin paintings, and Josh started a dinosaur painting. The hard part was making the snow have shadows and peaks even though it's all supposed to be the same color.",2,5
Rainbow Noodles,Varun Mangalick,noodles,"I wanted to experiment with shading, and I thought this would be a fun way to explore it in lots of different colors! The most challenging part was the self intersecting blue noodle because I wanted the two different parts of the blue noodle to look distinct.",2,6

Geometric Sunset,Varun Mangalick,sunset,"I started by making the sky and sun in a geometric fashion, then realized I didn't have a great idea what to do with the waves. My mental image was somewhat more like The Great Wave off Kanagawa, but my execution was lacking. I was disappointed in the waves when I first finished, but with some distance, I came to like the final product",3,1
Hollow Stump,Varun Mangalick,stump,"During a hike, I saw several beautiful and cozy looking tree stumps, some with puddles or mushrooms. I wanted to make my own version with all my favorite stump sights all together in one. This was one of the few paintings I had done at this point where there was no pictoral example, so I had to think a bit about how to compose the various elements in the stump.",3,2
Midnight Owl,Varun Mangalick,owl,"My hope for this painting was to give the sense of an owl at night. To do so, I made the background and even the owl's body/feathers very dark and low contrast, but made the eyes particularly bright in contrast. My hope was that at a distance, all that was visible were two eyes glowing in the night, but up close, you could make out the rest of the scene.",3,3

Glowing Alien Sphere,Varun Mangalick,sphere,"When painting this, I mainly wanted to experiment with a variety of textures, so I made the sky simple and abstract, but added clouds to give it a sense of scale. I added a sphere to the center and tried to make it glow via a red tinge around it and shadows on the buildings below. My hope was that it looked like some desolate alien landscape with a hint of civilization.",4,2
Propaganda Poster of a Plush Dino,Varun Mangalick,varun_dino,"This is one of my two favorite paintings that I've done on this wall. I hadn’t actually done any dinosaur paintings on this paint wall, so I thought I might as well revisit the old favorite subject. I tried to make the dinosaur fuzzy and 3d to contrast from the bright and flat colors in the background. By making it have propaganda poster vibe, I hoped to elevate the dinosaur as a subject!",4,3

Ocean in a Drop,Varun Mangalick,ocean_drop,"This is one of my two favorite paintings that I've done on this wall. I started by following a tutorial to paint a realistic water drop, then added my own touch of a whale and school of fish. I found the shadows were surprisingly effective in increasing the sense of realism. ",6,4
Water Drops,Neha Prasad,neha_drops,This is my first attempt at painting water drops. I followed a video tutorial but still found the technique quite challenging.  ,6,5
Autumn,Neha Prasad,neha_autumn,"For this paint night, I followed a video tutorial for an autumn scene with Yilun and Deep! This is my first painting on the wall, completed way back in spring 2021.",6,6

Autumn Leaves,Varun Mangalick,autumn_leaves,"For this paint night, three people followed a video teaching them to paint an autumn scene. I wanted to be contrarian, but still stick with the theme of autumn, so I decided to paint leaves. It was somewhat challenging to paint a variety of realistic looking leaves, especially if they're curved vs flat, and I tried my best to look up examples in doing so. As a fun challenge for you, see if you can find the three matching paintings that the others did!",8,1
Koi Pond,Varun Mangalick,koi,"This was the first proper painting I did with water colors (in contrast to acrylic). I was very happy with how the koi themselves turned out, but the water came out very splotchy. In addition, I actually had sketched a third koi, but accidentally painted over part of it with the blue. Unlike acrylic, once you've put down paint, you dan't always correct it!",8,2
